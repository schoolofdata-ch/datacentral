# About

**Datacentral** is a lightweight platform to easily publish and distribute datasets. It uses the [Data Packages](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification as a common format. By collecting datasets on this site, we make it easier for developers to plug data into projects. See the [Frictionless Data](http://frictionlessdata.io/) for more background.

There is an [online authoring](http://datapackagist.okfnlabs.org/) and [validation tool](http://data.okfn.org/tools/validate) for data packages developed by Open Knowledge. In CKAN portals, the [datapackager extension](https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-datapackager) allows exporting datasets as data packages.

For example data packages, browse [datahub.io](https://datahub.io) or the [github.com/datasets](https://github.com/datasets) organisation.

The [Datacentral](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/datacentral) platform used to build this site was initially developed for [Central de dados](http://centraldedados.pt/) project by [Open Knowledge Portugal](https://okfn.org/network/portugal/), [Journalism++](http://jplusplus.org/), and other open-source [contributors](https://github.com/centraldedados/datacentral/graphs/contributors).
